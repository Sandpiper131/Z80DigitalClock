# Z80 Digital Clock

## Description:
The Z80 Digital Clock is a culmination of my many years messing around with microprocessors. I decided on the Z80 due to its relatively straigh forward operation as opposed to x86 systems. This project was to apply all the knowledge I have learned failing to produce a working 8088 based computer. This clock displays Hours, Minutes, and Seconds and does so using an interupt from an Intel 82C53 Counter/Timer chip that is equally as vintage as the Z80.

## To Do: 
- [X] Clock Display
- [X] Reset Circuit
- [X] Basic Functionality (ROM and CPU)
- [X] 8255 Peripheral Chip
- [X] 8253 Counter/Timer
